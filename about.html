<article>
<p>I'm a self-taught developer with a background in literature and education; I've taught both programming & poetry, and they're really very similar.</p>
<p>I'm fascinated by language, education, technology, and the intersection of the three. My major motivator is curiosity - I thrive on learning new things and working out better ways to do old ones.</p>
<p>Currently, I work at a <a href="https://decoded.com" target="blank">technology education company</a> where I teach data science skills and develop/maintain applications that support delivering education at scale. I'm also studying for an MSc in Computer Science.</p>
